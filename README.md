# Smart Online Voting System

This project is a **Python-based Smart Online Voting System** that allows administrators to manage elections and voters to cast their votes securely.  
It demonstrates core concepts of e-voting, including:

- ✅ Voter registration & authentication  
- ✅ Secure vote casting  
- ✅ Admin management of elections and candidates  
- ✅ Database storage for votes and voter details  
- ✅ Modular design (separate files for voter, admin, server, and UI pages)  

> ⚠️ Note: This system is for **educational/demo purposes** and is **not production-ready** for real-world elections.
